**A blog about summer**

This summer, i decided to get away from the laziness inside me and decied to explore nyc. While people rush to tropical beaches or fly overseas, i found just as much enjoyment right here in the city.

Brooklyn is full of funny peole and       undiscoverd neighborhood with storys to tell. from food trucks to micky mouse in time square and late night fireworks. this is what a amazing summmer day look like for me.

**Morning disocvery**


I started my day with some homemade pancakes straight from the pan then headed straight into prospect park. Its my favorite place to stil and enjoying the scenery, the lake, duck island and dog musicians under the bridge. I even checked out the boat house for the first time.

 Then i walked around beford ave, popping my head into vintage shops and checking out some amazing food. Every corner feels like a new adventure.

**Evening**
When the lights came on, I took a slow walk along the sunset park area. You can’t beat the city skyline at night — it makes you fall in love with New York all over again.


**reflecting**
This day reminded me that adventure isn’t just in faraway places. Sometimes it’s right here — between your favorite deli and the edge of a waterfront park. Brooklyn has a rhythm of its own, and I’m glad I took the time this summer to slow down and really experience it.
